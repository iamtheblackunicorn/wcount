# WCOUNT :scroll:

***Count words from the command line. :scroll:***

## About :books:

I write a lot and sometimes I'm too lazy to paste stuff into Word. For this purpose I thought that I'd write a small little tool to count words in a specified document for me.

## INSTALLATION :inbox_tray:

I'm assuming you have Rust and Git installed and available from the command line. If you do, run this command to install ***WCount***:

```bash
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/wcount
```

## USAGE :hammer:

To use ***WCount***, simply run this command on a text file:

```bash
$ wcount my_file.txt
````

`my_file.txt` represents a file with some text inside it, it doesn't have to be a text file, though. It can be any file with some text inside it.

## CHANGELOG :black_nib:

### Version 1.0.0

- Initial release.
- Upload to GitHub.
